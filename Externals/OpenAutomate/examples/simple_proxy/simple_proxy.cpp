 * provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent
 * permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder
 * of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement
 * has been negotiated by the parties and their respective counsel and will
 * be interpreted fairly in accordance with its terms and without any
 * strict construction in favor of or against either party.
 * 
 * SECTION 8.9 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
